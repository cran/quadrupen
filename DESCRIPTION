Description: Fits classical sparse regression models with
    efficient active set algorithms by solving quadratic problems as described by 
    Grandvalet, Chiquet and Ambroise (2017) <arXiv:1210.2077>. Also provides a few 
    methods for model selection purpose (cross-validation, stability selection).
