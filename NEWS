NEWS/Changelog

0.2-3	(2013-08-26)
    +   added back the 'normalize' parameter
    +   standardization is performed within the C++ code
    +   use of sparse conversion from Matrix to Armadillo
    +   corrected bug with the 'intercept' and 'residuals' components of the quadrupen class
    +   added more tests in the inst directory
    +   correction in the documentation
    +   added r.squared to the quadrupen class

0.2-2	(2013-04-08)
    +   minor fix to comply with recent ggplot2 updates.

0.2-1	(2013-02-27)
    +   minor fix to pass CRAN check on Windows operating systems.

0.2-0	(2013-02-26)
    Major:
    +	added bounded regression (regression penalized by infinity norm + structered l2 norm)
    +   added corresponding functionalies for cross-validation and stability path
    Minor:
    +   corrected wrong annotations of the stability path (PFER)
    +   handled normalization internally ('normalize' is no longer a parameter)
    +   more simple internal handling of penscales and correction of the rescaling of the intercept
    +   better use of multicore features
    +   handled runtime error exception in RcppArmadillo when the system is singular (end of the solution path)
        A consequence is quadrupen is less likely to crash due to user's "bad" parametrization
    +   simplification of the C++ code, bugs corrected, probably new ones added :-'(
    +   added 'examples' and 'tests' directories

0.1-0	(2012-10-09)
    +	first build: structured elastic-net with (weighted) quadratic loss, cross-validation and stability selection methods.
